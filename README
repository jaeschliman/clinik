* Common Lisp Including Nikodemus-style Nicknames
  
  The (main) aim of this project is simple:
  
  I'd like to able to write some Common Lisp libraries using
  package-local nicknames that I'm confident can run on the major
  open-source CL implementations: CCL, SBCL, ABCL, and (eventually)
  ECL. SBCL and ABCL already have this feature.
  
  
  The (practical) aim of this project is twofold:
  
** provide a working specification and test-suite for nikodemus-style nicknames
   
   as far as I know, they are currently implemented in SBCL and ABCL,
   though still somewhat experimental. I've collected links to some
   relevant SBCL commits, still need to do so for ABCL, and write up a
   test suite/working spec.
   
** implement them for CCL
   
   When I brought up adding this feature to CCL, The maintainers expressed some reluctance.
   
   TODO: provide links to gmane discussion on openmcl list
   
      - CCL has some caching optimizations around package lookup, which Mr. Byers indicates
        were added to satisfy a client who found that package lookup was consuming a significant
        portion of their application's runtime. This is with global package names! So any
        modification of the CCL package system will have to integrate with their optimizations,
        and produce as small of a performance hit as possible in the typical case.
        
      - It was also expressed in this discussion that this feature
        (package-local-nicknames) may not be good enough by itself. In
        the mailing list discussion it was proposed to add a special
        metaclass for non-standard package types and then provide the
        needed specialization via some CLOS methods on package lookup.
